# Vlad's stupid crypto library

**DO NOT USE THIS FOR *ANY* PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT, UNSAFE, SLOW AND STUIPD**

---

This is a library encompassing multiple crypto functions, starting from historical ones to the more modern which serves to teach people (and me) on how these things work.
Security and speed were NOT an objective of this libary instead focusing on readability and faithfulness.
All functions take as an input a text file and output it to the stdout in either UTF-8 for the compatible ones or HEX for the others.
